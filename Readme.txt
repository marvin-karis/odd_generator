The code above is a program that uses the API Football API to get the head to head match results between two teams. It then uses the data from the API response to create a dataset of match results. This dataset is then used to train a Naive Bayes classifier which is used to calculate the probability of each team winning a match. Finally, the probabilities are printed out for the user.
